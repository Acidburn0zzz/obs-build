.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbuild\fR is a tool to build SuSE Linux RPMs in a safe and clean way.
.B build
will install a minimal SuSE Linux as build system into some directory
and will chroot to this system to compile the package.
This way you don't risk to corrupt your working system (due to a broken spec
file for example), even if the package does not use BuildRoot.

.B build
searches the spec file for a
.I BuildRequires:
line; if such a line is found, all the specified rpms are installed.
Otherwise a selection of default packages are used. Note that
.B build
doesn't automatically resolve missing dependencies, so the specified
rpms have to be sufficient for the build.
.P
If a spec file is specified on the command line,
.B build
will use this file and all other files in the directory for building
the package. If a srcrpm is specified,
.B build
automatically unpacks it for the build.
If neither is given,
.B build
will use all the specfiles in the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --clean
remove the build system and reinitialize it from scratch.
.TP
.B --no-init
skip the build system initialization and start with build immediately.
.TP
.BI "\-\-rpms " path1 : path2 : path3\fR...\fP
Where build can find the SuSE Linux RPMs needed to create the
build system. This option overrides the BUILD_RPMS environment
variable.
.TP
.BI "\-\-arch " arch1 : arch2 : arch3\fR...\fP
What architectures to select from the RPMs.
.B build
automatically sets this to a sensible value for your host if you
don't specify this option.
.TP
.BI "\-\-root " buildroot
Specifies where the build system is set up. Overrides the
BUILD_ROOT enviroment variable.
.TP
.B "\-\-useusedforbuild"
Tell build not to do dependency expansion, but to extract the
list of packages to install from "usedforbuild" lines or, if none
are found, from all "BuildRequires" lines. This option is useful
if you want to re-build a package from a srcrpm with exactly the
same packages used for the srcrpm build.
.TP
.B --help
Print a short help text.
.TP
.B --verify
verify the files in an existing build system.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B BUILD_ROOT
The directory where build should install the chrooted build system.
"/var/tmp/build-root" is used by default.
.TP
.B BUILD_RPMS
Where build can find the SuSE Linux RPMs.  build needs them to create the
build system.  "/media/dvd/suse" is the default value which will do
the trick if you have the SuSE Linux DVD mounted.
.TP
.B BUILD_RPM_BUILD_STAGE
The rpm build stage (-ba, -bb, ...).  This is just passed through to
rpm, check the rpm manpage for a complete list and descriptions.
"-ba" is the default.
You can use this to add more options to RPM.
